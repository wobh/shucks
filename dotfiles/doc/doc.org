* TODO =alt= Alternate implementations

The main problem is this is intended to be installed in a user's home
directory. We assume the user has a =~/bin= (a common but not
necessary true assumption). There's only a few standard accepted ways
share data across scripts for this sort of thing.

- duplicate in the source itself. The current solution.
- setup dotfile for it. ".dottext"
- setup a dot folder (it could hold everything)
  - ~/
    - .dotfiles/
      - dotenvs
      - dotlist
      - dottext
      - dotkeep/
- I'm even tempted to do something like this:
  - ~/
    - .dotfiles/
      - etc/
	- dotenvs
      - lib/
	- dottext
      - var/
	- dotlist
      - srv
	- dotkeep/

** TODO =shm4=
Maybe use m4.

1. setup make target
2. m4 process inserting message texts and other common elements to scripts

** TODO =ruby=
- implement in Ruby
- maybe use thor
- still need to figure out reasonable way to share data across scripts.
** TODO =lisp=
I should do this, if for no other reason just to clarify option
testing a control flow.
* TODO =bin= Executables
** Decision tables key
